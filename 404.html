Note to self: A workaround to solve the GitHub 404-problem

https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/08/sghpa-single-page-app-hack-github-pages/

https://github.com/csuwildcat/sghpa/blob/master/404.html

Buchner's initial idea was to clone the 'index.html' file and rename it '404.html'. This way, the user would not see a custom 404-page but a page (visually) identical to the home page. It turns out, however, that this is not good for SEO as the page is still served with a status code of 404.

So, Buchner came up with the idea of a meta-based redirect routine instead. A meta tag with a refresh value of 0 appears to be treated as a 301 redirect by search engines, which works out well for this use case.

Necessity: This file must total more than 512 bytes. If it does not, Internet Explorer will disregard it and show a generic browser 404 page instead.
